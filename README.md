# Year-vs-GDP-simple-linear-regression


So this is a program which is based on simple linear regression model. First we take the data(.csv file) in our dataset object and then we split our dataset into train set and test set in 70:30 ratio respectively. Then we fitted our train set in our regression model and after that we plot our train set and test set along with the regressor line.
